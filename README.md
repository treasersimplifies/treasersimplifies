## About Me

+ Currently, I do all things about **blockchain**, if you're interested in blockchain then contact me.
+ **Blockchain** is one of most important technology/economics for digital society.
+ The sequence of the digital wave will be digital finance, digital economy, and finally digital society.
+ People who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world are the ones who do.
+ Other technology that will change the world:
  + Genetic Engineering
  + AI & Generalized Automation
  + Quantum Technology
  + Space Technology
  + New Energy
+ Technology alone is not enough, it's technology married with liberal arts married with humanities that makes our heart sing.
+ The best way to convey personal opinions to society is no longer literature, but its compound form(e.g. **motion picture**...)
